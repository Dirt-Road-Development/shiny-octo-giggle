## Overview

SKALE Network is a decentralized and modular EVM compatible multichain network that scales Ethereum transactions.
Developers use SKALE Chains to build and deploy performant and user-centric decentralized applications.

The distribution and staking of the $SKL hybrid utility token enables decentralized governance of SKALE Network.

Staked $SKL tokens enable voting on SKALE DAO governance proposals, thereby facilitating $SKL delegators to
collaboratively guide the evolution of SKALE.

## What is SKALE?

SKALE Network is a high-performance, cost-effective blockchain network that complements Ethereum.
Developers utilize SKALE to build user-friendly and performant decentralized applications (dApps)
benefiting from the scalability offered by the SKALE Network.

Launched in 2020, the SKALE Network has continuously improved its performance and scalability.
The $SKL hybrid utility tokens facilitates decentralized control over the SKALE Network and its underlying infrastructure. 
Staked $SKL tokens permit voting on SKALE DAO governance proposals, enabling $SKL token holders who stake to influence
the future of SKALE collectively.

## What is governance?

Governance refers to decision-making processes and actions by which systems update and maintain themselves.
Traditional governance in companies, governments, and institutions involves a decision making process that
is relatively centralized and permissioned - for example processes that are made by a board of directors elected by shareholders.

Blockchain technologies, like SKALEâ€™s protocols and chains, are initially developed by companies but progressively become decentralized
with the growth of a user and stakeholder community. This progressive decentralization typically involves DAO formation and launching a
process by which certain stake holders may vote. In this way, The SKALE DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, has decision-making
authority over the SKALE Network and its associated technologies. To steer the SKALE DAO, staking $SKL tokens signifies DAO membership. Staked
token holders can vote on DAO proposals.
