description: SKALE network explanation
---

The SKALE Network is an open-source, Ethereum-native multichain network built to scale Ethereum dApps with a focus on high-throughput, fast finality, and zero gas fee transactions via the native gas token sFuel.

The ecosystem has over 120 nodes. However all this nodes are not responsible to make only one chain. The nodes are arranged in a way that allow the existence of several different chains hence SKALE being a multichain network.

## Schain Creation

Each individual SKALE chain follows the following creation process:
- A call is made to the SKALE manager contract on the Ethereum mainnet
- 16 randomly picked nodes are chosen out of the existing pool of the networtk
- A DKG round is performed and each node gets is own secret key to be able to then participate of the consensus rounds

## Schain caracheristics

Every SKALE chain created possess the following caracheristics:
- Zero gas fees since the native token, sFUEL, has no economic value
- Fast transactions per second (TPS), up to 700 tps
- High block gas limit, 268 million block gas limit
- Fully compatible with Ethereum-native network which means all solidity smart contracts as well as typical wallets (ex: Metamask) works
- Native SKALE bridge called IMA that enables the following communication: Ethereum--SKALE Chain and SKALE Chain--SKALE Chain 
- Native Oracle called SKALE connect allows to access any external data through a JSON RPC request
